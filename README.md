check_elasticsearch
===================

This is a simple Icinga/Nagios/â€¦ plugin for checking an
[Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) cluster written in Go
using [fractalcat/nagiosplugin](https://github.com/fractalcat/nagiosplugin).

It serves three purposes:

* To gain experience with go

* To gain experience with Elasticsearch

* To monitor Elastiscsearch hopefully more efficient than a Python test

While it serves the first and second purpose and it does indeed a basic
monitoring there are more sophisticated plugins avaiable.
